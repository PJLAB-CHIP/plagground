Usage : bash scripts/build.sh [options]

Options for controlling build process.
======================================

Release
    Release build with the best optimization strategy (`-O3` for GCC and Clang, `/O2` for MSVC).

Debug
    Debug build with no optimization strategy. Debug information will be included in the compiled
    executable.

-cf | --clean-first
    Clean the build directory and then build the project. This clean process is controlled by the
    build system, so some files may not be removed. If you want a thorough clean, use `-ca` or 
    `--clean-all`.
    
-ca | --clean-all
    Remove the build directory and then build the project.

Options for testing.
====================

-v<version> | --test-kernel-verion=<version>
    Set the kernel version for testing. 

-f32 | --float32
    Set the data type to be float32.

-f16 | --float16
    Set the data type to be float16.
